# Goal

## Know what you're getting yourself into

<br><br>

### _Help me help you:_

How many here use dbt?

How many don't and are considering implementation?

How many are responsible for running dbt in production?

# Production dbt-ing

- Can be as simple as the CLI operations you‚Äôre already familiar with
- Not very resource-intensive
  - Meaningful compute handled by DWH
- Does write out a lot of files
  - `target-path`, `packages-install-path`, `log-path` can help with this
- Still requires a Python env
- New in 1.5 - [programmatic invocations](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/programmatic-invocations)

<br><br>
üëâ `dbt run` via programmatic and CLI invocations

# The first steps

- **Regular manual runs**
- **Cron**
- **CI/CD tooling schedulers**
  - GitHub Actions
  - CircleCI
  - Jenkins
- **Basic cloud schedulers**
  - ECS scheduled tasks
  - GCP Cloud Scheduler
  - Azure Batch Scheduler

::right::
![](/calendar.png)

<br>

```shell
‚ùØ crontab -l
# run dbt every hour
0 0 * * * dbt run
```

<br>

```yml
# .circleci/config.yml
jobs:
  run-dbt:
    steps: [checkout, {"run": "dbt run"}]
workflows:
  daily-run-dbt:
    jobs:
      - run-dbt:
          triggers: [{"schedule": {"cron": "0 0 * * *"}}]
```

---
layout: statement
hideInToc: true
---

# _Checkpoint_

## When have you outgrown basic schedulers?

<br><br>

### _Some ideas:_

You run a lot of jobs for a lot of the day

You have multiple jobs running at once

Your jobs have complex dependencies

Your platform team says CircleCI costs too much

---
layout: two-cols
---

# Orchestrators

- **For more complex scheduling**
  - Running more than just dbt
  - Managing multiple dbt runs
  - Coupling your ingestion with dbt
  - Other ways to start jobs (i.e. sensors)
  - Define your jobs in code
- **We‚Äôre going to talk about Airflow, but there‚Äôs alternatives**
  - dbt Cloud
  - Established: Dagster, Prefect
  - Newer: Mage, Argo
  - Older: Luigi, Oozie, Azkaban

# BashOperator issues

- **Requirements whack-a-mole**
  - ü´† [Official AWS MWAAA guide about working around conflicting dependencies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/samples-dbt.html)
- **File writing conflicts**
  - dbt artifacts + target + logs can be overwritten by concurrent DAG runs - or not written at all
    - Differs between managed Airflow services
  - üí≠ If redirecting to `/tmp`, clean it up!
- **Lifecycle conflicts**
  - Upgrading dbt involves requirements changes for your entire Airflow instance
  - In some managed services this can mean downtime

# What now?

- ü§† **Get hackin‚Äô**
  - `PythonVirtualenvOperator`
  - Call a full script from the BashOperator or PythonOperator
    1. Create a venv
    2. Install dependencies to that venv
    3. Run dbt
    4. Clean up*
- üê≥ **Get containerizin‚Äô**
  - Isolate dbt from Airflow
  - Trade code complexity for infra complexity
  - Give Airflow much less to do

# Containerization Basics

- `DockerOperator`, `ECSOperator`, or `KubernetesPodOperator`
  - Each isolate your tasks from others
  - Each require some infra work outside Airflow (K8s cluster, ECS cluster, container registry)
- In general - why containerize?
  - Scalability - vertically and horizontally
  - Isolation
- Downsides
  - Complexity
  - In the context of Airflow, local dev gets even more difficult

# Running dbt via the ECSOperator

  # same as before

# Is this‚Ä¶ good?

<br>

üò¨ I think this is the most scalable way to run dbt on Airflow

üôÇ We‚Äôre happy with it for our workload

ü´† It feels more complex than it needs to be

üêô Airflow is probably not the executor of the future

üö¶ SLAs are all green, and we have plenty of headroom to scale
